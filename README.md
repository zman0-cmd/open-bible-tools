#ARCHIVE NOTE

-hey, so this project died before it even got started. FLOSS did not really fulfill the needs of OBT.org... I need to ensure theological consistency and want to be able to monitor changes and control the project more than an OSS project could dream to have. 

To the two people who will ever read this. I hope youll understand. Thanks -ZM`

A **Free & Open-Source Toolkit** for Bible study.  

I wanted a **simple, reliable Bible reading plan generator**, but I couldn't find one that met my needs—so I built my own. This project is an ongoing effort to create useful, open-source tools for Bible study.

## 🚧 **Under Construction**  

This project is a **work in progress** by a single dev **(me)** with almost no coding experience. Expect rough edges, but I'm learning as I go!  

🔹 **Want to help?** Please submit [issues](https://github.com/zman0-cmd/open-bible-tools/issues) and feature requests—it helps a lot!  
🔹 I'm using this project to learn **JavaScript** and **HTML**, so improvements may take time.

### **Recent Changes**

- Look at the change log for current updates!
- **03/17/25** - Refactored code for better previews.
- **03/16/25** – Implemented **PDF Generation** using jsPDF. Still need to refactor math functions into a separate utility script.
- **03/14/25** – Added a **custom end date** feature. Realized I call the same math functions in multiple places—need to unify them later.
- **03/11/25** – Initial launch with a very rough (sorry y’all) code structure.

## 🎯 **Current Goals**

- ✅ **Bible Reading Plan Generator** *(functional, but improving)*
- 🛠️ **Portable Text-to-Speech (TTS) for Bible Reading** *(in progress)*
- 📚 **More Bible study tools** *(TBD, open to ideas!)*  

> Who knows where this will go? My goal is to **actually see this through to completion**.  

For now, the **best way to support this project** is through **issue reports, suggestions, and code contributions**. Financial support *might* be an option later, but I'm praying and seeking wisdom before making that decision.
