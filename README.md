A **Free & Open-Source Toolkit** for Bible study.  

I wanted a **simple, reliable Bible reading plan generator**, but I couldn't find one that met my needs—so I built my own. This project is an ongoing effort to create useful, open-source tools for Bible study.

## 🚧 **Under Construction**  

This project is a **work in progress** by a single dev **(me)** with almost no coding experience. Expect rough edges, but I'm learning as I go!  

🔹 **Want to help?** Please submit [issues](https://github.com/zman0-cmd/open-bible-tools/issues) and feature requests—it helps a lot!  
🔹 I'm using this project to learn **JavaScript** and **HTML**, so improvements may take time.

### **Recent Changes**

- Look at the change log for current updates!
- **03/17/25** - Refactored code for better previews.
- **03/16/25** – Implemented **PDF Generation** using jsPDF. Still need to refactor math functions into a separate utility script.
- **03/14/25** – Added a **custom end date** feature. Realized I call the same math functions in multiple places—need to unify them later.
- **03/11/25** – Initial launch with a very rough (sorry y’all) code structure.

## 🎯 **Current Goals**

- ✅ **Bible Reading Plan Generator** *(functional, but improving)*
- 🛠️ **Portable Text-to-Speech (TTS) for Bible Reading** *(in progress)*
- 📚 **More Bible study tools** *(TBD, open to ideas!)*  

> Who knows where this will go? My goal is to **actually see this through to completion**.  

For now, the **best way to support this project** is through **issue reports, suggestions, and code contributions**. Financial support *might* be an option later, but I'm praying and seeking wisdom before making that decision.
